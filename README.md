# Blueasy---A-Minimal-Agency-Website
Blueasy - A Minimal Agency Website

This project is a modern, responsive agency website built using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. It serves as a great example of a multi-section landing page, demonstrating effective use of modern web development techniques.

Features
Clean and Minimal Design: A sleek and professional aesthetic suitable for agency and portfolio websites.

Fully Responsive Layout: Designed to look great and function flawlessly across all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

HTML5 Semantic Structure: Organized and accessible HTML markup.

CSS3 Styling with Flexbox & Grid: Leverages the power of CSS Flexbox and Grid for robust and flexible layout management, forming the core skeleton of the project.

Interactive Navigation: A responsive hamburger menu implemented with vanilla JavaScript for an enhanced mobile user experience.

Smooth Scrolling: Provides a smooth navigation experience between sections.

Contact Form: A basic contact form section (note: form submission functionality is client-side only and requires backend integration for full functionality).

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content.

CSS3: For styling, including:

Flexbox: Used for one-dimensional layouts (e.g., navigation bars, social icons).

CSS Grid: Utilized for two-dimensional layouts (e.g., services boxes, portfolio images, contact form layout).

CSS Variables: For maintainable and consistent styling.

Media Queries: For responsive design breakpoints.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For interactive elements, primarily the responsive navigation toggle.

Font Awesome: For scalable vector icons.

Google Fonts (Montserrat): For modern and legible typography.
